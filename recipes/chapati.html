    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose of flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Any vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate jar/ bowl. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix well.</li>
        <li>Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough becomes non-sticky. Add 2-3 tbsp of oil and continue kneading until the oil mixes well and the dough is soft. Cover the dough and leave it for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts making ball like shapes. Arrange them in a flat surface dusted with flour(Cover with a damp tablecloth to avoid drying).</li>
        <li>Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start rolling with a rolling pin to a circular shape, brush oil on top and roll it inwards to form a shape-like a rope, then create a coil-like shape and press the ball down with your palm to make it flat. Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining balls of dough.</li>
        <li>Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the rolling pin to form a circular shape again.</li>
        <li>In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. Place your cooked chapati in a flat plat and cover with an aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough.</li>
    </ol>
