This is a recipes project. 
Refer to: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

This project is a demonstration of my skills in:
1. HTML
2. Git & Github
3. Command line
3. Hosting website on github pages

I am proud in learning web dev from the ground up rather that starting at the top level then trying to figure out the basics.
